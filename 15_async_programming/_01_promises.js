// Promises are the foundation of asynchronous programming in modern JavaScript. A promise is an object returned by an asynchronous function, which represents the current state of the operation. At the time the promise is returned to the caller, the operation often isn't finished, but the promise object provides methods to handle the eventual success or failure of the operation.

const fetchPromise = fetch("https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/apis/fetching-data/can-store/products.json",);
console.log(fetchPromise);
fetchPromise.then((response) => {
    console.log(`Received Message: ${response.status}`);
});

console.log("Started request..");

// Note that Started request… is logged before we receive the response. Unlike a synchronous function, fetch() returns while the request is still going on, enabling our program to stay responsive.
